# Mavkit
Mavkit is a plugin-based engine for creating vector 2D hardware-accelerated
applications, such as a [digital assistant](https://github.com/mav-assistant/mav-core)
or a game.

It comes with:
 * A 2D rendering system inspired by the HTML5 canvas, powered by NanoVG
 * Support for OpenGL 2 and OpenGL ES 2, taking advantage of 3 when possible
 * TrueType font support
 * XDG Basedir support (your Linux users will thank you)
 * Full support for Linux, Windows, and Mac (in order of priority)

Things it will come with, but aren't implemented yet:
 * A widget-based UI
 * Easy screenshots and videos
 * Event-driven input system, with support for controllers
 * Audio system
