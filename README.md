# Mav
Mav is a personal assistant, focused on modularity. It's similar in concept to
Google Now, Cortana, and Siri.

The plan is for the majority of functionality to be implemented via plugins,
which includes the appearance of the assistant, the text-to-speech engine, the
speech recognition engine, etc.

**Mav is not yet ready for use.** Once it is, this README will be filled in.
