Mav
===
**Modular Assistant (Voice)**

Mav is a personal assistant, similar to Google Now, Microsoft Cortana, Apple's Siri, and ILA.
It is written in Java 7, and uses FreeTTS and Sphinx-4 by default, but can be configured to use Google's cloud APIs.

It is heavily inspired by ILA, but is designed to be fully modular and customizable, and open-source from the start.

**Mav is not at all ready for use yet.** You have been warned.
